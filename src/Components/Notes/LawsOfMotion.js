            <h3>Class 11 Physics Chapter 5- Laws of Motion</h3>
            <p>A force is something that causes a body's rest or motion to alter. An interaction between two bodies is also referred to as force. Two bodies exert forces on each other even if they are not physically in contact,<br/> e.g., the electrostatic force between two charges or gravitational force between any two bodies.
            <br/>
                It is a vector quantity having SI unit Newton (N) and dimension [MLT−−2]
                .
                <br/>
                Superposition of Force:  When many forces are acting on a body then their resultant is obtained by the law of vector addition:
                <br/>
                Fres.−→−=F1−→+F2−→+F3−→..............+Fn−→
                <br/>
                Fres.−→−=F1−→2+F2−→2+2F1−→F2−→cosθ−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
                <br/>
                tanα=F2sinθF1+F2cosθ 
                <br/>
                The resultant of the two forces F1−→
                and F2−→
                acting at angle θ
                is given by: Fres.−→−=F1−→2+F2−→2+2F1−→F2−→cosθ−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
                <br/>
                The resultant force is directed at an angle α with respect to force F1 where:
                <br/>
                tanα=F2sinθF1+F2cosθ
                <br/>
                Lami’s Theorem:
                If three forces F1 , F2 and F3 are acting simultaneously on a body and the body is in equilibrium, then according to Lami’s theorem:
                <br/>
                F1sin(π−α)=F2sin(π−β)=F3sin(π−γ)
                where α, β & γ are the angles opposite to the forces F1 , F2 & F3 respectively.
